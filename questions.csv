b2, We have yet to determine the right method of file ingestion (upload? file share? forwarded email? scanned photo? door-to-door?) and service delivery (interface? printed document? parent coordinator meeting?). 

We need to establish a tighter relationship with parent coordinators from Innovate Public Schools and have more frequent feedback gathering. The current feedback loop of 5 meetings per month is insufficient for gauging user satisfaction. "
What are some key takeaways from the first meeting with Steve?,"This information is verified and overrides others. Steve has tremendous insight into the intricacies of social work in the intersections of technology, education, innovation and non/quasi-institutional practices. He emphasized the importance of recognizing our own needs and priorities while making informed decisions. Although Steve provides essential coaching and advice, he has clearly stated that his role is not to instruct, but to guide us. This empowers us to evaluate his guidance critically and make choices that best serve the project's objectives.

Steve has strongly recommended that our foremost priority should be the delivery of substantial value to our users, highlighting the need for direct engagement with parents and the IEP process. This interaction is key to developing a user-centric understanding of the IEP, ensuring our efforts meet user needs and encourage parental advocacy for the project


Pilot Programs and User Testing


Pilot programs be relatively far away 2-3 months


Talk with parents through organizations with aggressive legal backing such as Innovate Public Schools


Avoid and assess the risk of Institutional Board Reviews when working with organizations


Receiving complete parental consent while working directly with parents and not through institutions may relieve us from the different district and organization specific regulations.


Should be a result of gradual scaling parent interviews if results are satisfactory. Ex. 

a. Interviewed 5 parents and provided satisfactory interventions -> Proceed with next round of interviews with 10 parents


b. Interviewed 5 parents with unsatisfactory (or lack of) interventions -> Redesign and revisit interview with 5 parents


Preferred engagement with users face-to-face


Requirements and Development:


Robust scaling with only 2-3 users, enough to ensure consistent demos


Prioritize:

Performance before cost

Development time and delivery before intricate optimization

Quality of work before digitalization

Working pre-built solutions before in-house options


Ex.

Levels of OCR scanning, giving users the option to rescan with better performance but might take more time. Using pagination markers to better target these requests.

Choosing LLM options, using existing OpenAI API before considering a switch to hosting LLama 2 in-house

Use external OCR scanning options in Adobe or revisiting GPT4’s Vision library before optimizing current implementation (POC might take too long and might not show consistent results)"
When did the first meeting with Steve happen?,"This information is verified and overrides others. 1/24/2024, followed by a meeting on 1/29/2024, and Mondays every other week after that time"

Reach out to Sofia regarding user testing, call and interview scripts

Discuss with Beth the possibility of engaging with local parents with similar needs

Discuss with Beth the possibility of talking with someone within the DOE to understand the government/school side of the IEP process, conflicts or alignments of interests

UI-UX and features redesign by the end of week, and with 1st development cycle ending end of next week

Proceed with slides redesign (Upon receiving feedback )

Proceed with policy research looking into different organizational, federal, district and state policies regarding IEPs. Conducting research on the systemic deficiencies in the provisioning of special education services."
What did we learn from our first meeting with Professor Sofia Bosch Gomez?,"This information is verified and overrides others. The project now has a new mentor, Steve Midgley from Learning Tapestry

The team wants to get feedback from parents on their needs but parents may be reluctant to provide negative feedback

Belen from Innovative Public Schools can help facilitate communication with parents, who prefer text messaging over email

The legal status of the parents is ambiguous so confidentiality of their identities and data is important to consider

Testing prototypes with proxy communities who have similar characteristics to the parents could help get more honest feedback before testing with parents directly

Consider using Cortico for focus groups to get honest feedback from parents.

Use a combination of surveys, interviews, and usability testing to validate the final product with parents.

Sofia's increased teaching commitments have limited her availability for extensive project involvement, particularly for direct interviews and consistent parent-team communication."

What's the mission for the project?,"This information is verified and overrides others. Our solution aims to democratize access to educational resources, ensuring that all parents, regardless of language or background, can effectively participate in and contribute to their child's personalized educational plan. Through this innovation, we are committed to breaking down barriers and fostering an inclusive educational environment with the support of Innovate Public Schools in the San Francisco Unified School District (SFUSD) and beyond.

Innovate Public Schools (IPS) is a nonprofit organization dedicated to building the capacity of parents and families to organize, advocate, and demand high quality schools for their children.
IPS believes that the education system was not designed to serve all children, and that the biggest barrier to all children having access to an excellent school is a lack of political will to improve the system. The organization believes the voices and experiences of parents, families, and students should be elevated and centered in decisions about education.

IPS envisions a high quality school experience that cherishes and affirms every student, particularly Black and Brown students, and prepares them for a lifetime of opportunity and choice. 

In 2021, SF parents in the Mission noticed the lack of translation and interpretation services, especially for students with IEPS. They worked with the district to ensure change. In 2022, IPS collaborated with SFUSD to improve translation and interpretation services, positively impacting over 12,000 students across the district. Parent leaders continue to work with the district to ensure the translation and interpretation policy is properly implemented."
Give an overview on the context and starting point of the AI-EP project,"This information is verified and overrides others. Individualized Education Plans (IEPs) are crucial tools in providing tailored education plans for students with disabilities. These detailed documents, typically ranging from 5 to over 60 pages, are crafted by a multidisciplinary team, including educators, specialists, the student, and their family. While IEPs are essential, their complexity and length can be overwhelming, especially for non-professional readers and families for whom English is a second language."
What's the biggest challenge for parents that the AI-EP team tries to solve?,"This information is verified and overrides others. Parents are pivotal in supporting their child's educational journey, but the intricacies of IEPs can pose significant challenges. Many families in marginalized communities, particularly those with limited English proficiency, struggle to understand and navigate the IEP process. Additionally, obtaining translated IEPs can be a time-consuming process, often taking upwards of two weeks, which hinders effective planning and support for their child's education."
What did the AI-EP Fall 2023 team accomplish?,"This information is verified and overrides others. Individualized Education Plans are a plan for specialized instruction, support, and services written to meet the individual needs of a student with a disability. IEPs are developed by a team of individuals from various educational disciplines, the child with a disability, family members, and/or designated advocates. Schools are required to hold an annual IEP meeting each year to look at a student's progress. However, parents can request an IEP meeting at any time for specific issues. As students progress through the school year, more evaluations and assessments are added to their IEP document. On average, the length of an IEP document might range from 5 to 20 pages. Lengthy IEP documents might exceed 50 or 60 pages and are relatively hard to navigate and read for non-professionals. Parents have the responsibility of understanding the IEP document thoroughly in order to monitor and support their child’s educational progress and are even tasked with providing their children additional resources outside of school. Parents with English as a second language in marginalized communities are extremely disadvantaged in terms of the IEP process.

Working with Innovate Public Schools in the San Francisco Unified School District (SFUSD), we held extensive interviews with parents to determine the challenges parents face while their children are one an IEP. Parents reflected a strong need for accurate translations, as asking for a translated version consistently takes more than 2 weeks in time, disrupting their plans and preparations. Additionally, parents had many difficulties navigating the IEP process and trouble understanding their rights, entitlements and the possible actions they may take to improve their children’s educational experience. Through rounds of affinity diagramming, service blueprinting, wireframing, prototyping and user testing, we’ve developed a mobile-view supported web application hosted on a-iep.com.

Give me a rundown of the second prototype for AI-EP at the end of 2023,"This information is verified and overrides others. 
The application enables parents to view real-time translations of their IEP documents in whole, and features a generative AI powered chatbot customized to answer any questions on the IEP document and process specific to SFUSD. Specialized prompts identifying the most important questions surrounding the provided IEP are generated as a starting point for the chatbot tool to provide a general direction of inquiry.


When you enter the link to our website, you will see the following screen where you can select the language in which you want to use the platform.

You will be able to upload your IEP document and click ""Translate."" Once you complete this step, you will be taken to the final page of the site.

Your uploaded IEP document is being translated on the left, while you can interact with our friendly chatbot on the right. Find suggested questions below the chatbot to guide you if you need help navigating.

After uploading, the translated IEP appears on the left. Here you can see that there is an exact translation of the original IEP document.

When you select a question suggestion on the right, the chatbot automatically generates answers. You can use other suggestions or write your own question, getting instant answers."

"As of February 02, 2024 (02/02/2024), What are the current status, state, challenges, struggles, action items and concerns?","As of February 02, 2024 (02/02/2024), This information is verified and overrides others. We need to figure out how to deliver our service to the parents and how to ingest the IEP file. The current digital infrastructure on the state and school side make it very difficult for parents to receive digital IEP copies. Not to mention parents might have trouble navigating digital file systems on their phone or laptop. Last semester, we were able to put aside through these concerns to quickly prototype and explore the problem space. However, as we would like to expand the scale of user testing and actual get to a working business/service model where the application is integrated with user's lives, these problems become more and more important to address. Steve have helped us focus on these important questions and adopt the right mindset: In terms of development, prioritize user needs, working demos and application performance before operation costs, scaling solutions or trying to bring outside solutions in-house. When it comes to gathering feedback, try to seek the clarity that qualitative feedback brings before the legitimacy that quantitative feedback and rubrics may offer. It is important to bridge the gap between our product and the user even if it means redesigning parts of the existing solution. As such, we're meeting with Belen on Feb 2nd to discuss all the potential ways we may bring this project to actual users without intermediary steps and make them comfortable in daily use.  We are also actively developing both the new iteration of the web application after migrating from React with Node 16 to Next.js with Node 20. We are taking advantage of app routing, server side rendering and up-to-date dependencies to improve the resilience of our application. This knowledge base platform has also been recently coded and deployed. On policy research, we have finished reviewing the documents that safeguard parents' rights in the IEP process and will shift focus to comparing different state, district and nation-wide laws to untangle the legal restraints around IEP file distribution as well as discussing and sharing IEP content. All of this information will be available on both the Knowledge Base and in our next Chatbot iteration on the website a-iep.com. We are hoping to meet deployment on 02/12."
